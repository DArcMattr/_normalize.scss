<h1 id="normalize.scss-v1.0.1"><code>_normalize.scss</code> v1.0.1</h1>
<p><code>_normalize.scss</code> is a customisable SASS file that makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards--derived from Nicholas Gallagher's Normalize.css project. It is the result of researching the differences between default browser styles in order to precisely target only the styles that need normalizing.</p>
<p><a href="http://darcmattr.github.com/normalize.css/1.0.0/test.html">Check out the demo</a></p>
<h2 id="what-does-it-do">What does it do?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Preserves useful defaults, unlike many CSS resets.</li>
<li>Normalizes styles for a wide range of elements.</li>
<li>Corrects bugs and common browser inconsistencies.</li>
<li>Improves usability with subtle improvements.</li>
<li>Explains what code does using detailed comments.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-use-it">How to use it</h2>
<p>I intend <code>_normalize.scss</code> to be used as a declaration of many default styles that I use in Ayn Rand Institute web projects, and for working around many browser quirks. It has been adapted for use as an <code>@import</code> into a site's stylesheet, and compiled in using <a href="http://compass-style.org">Compass</a>. A standalone version is generated for sites where the entirety of the source markup is out of my hands.</p>
<h3 id="from-nicholas-gallagher-necolas">From Nicholas Gallagher (necolas):</h3>
<p>Normalize.css is intended to be used as an alternative to CSS resets.</p>
<p>It's suggested that you read the <code>normalize.css</code> file and consider customising it to meet your needs. Alternatively, include the file in your project and override the defaults later in your CSS.</p>
<h2 id="browser-support">Browser support</h2>
<p>I am tracking the v1 series, because I want to keep some old browser support around, these old browsers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Chrome</li>
<li>Mozilla Firefox 3+ (the Long-Term Support release of Firefox is based on v3)</li>
<li>Apple Safari 4+ (because some people haven't upgraded their iOS version)</li>
<li>Opera 10+</li>
<li>Internet Explorer 6+ (better in here than in my main CSS files)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="contribute">Contribute</h2>
<p>Please contribute to the upstream project: Please read the <a href="https://github.com/necolas/issue-guidelines">issue guidelines</a>. Issue reports to me are welcome, but either address a matter of my personal taste or site standards, or ultimately rely on the work of the upstream maintainers. Only one of those is a &quot;public&quot; problem (hint, it's upstream).</p>
<h2 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2>
